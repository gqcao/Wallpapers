# My Desktop Wallpaper Collection
This is a collection of most wallpapers I used in my home laptop besides some personal pictures. The idea of having this repo was inspired by DistroTube's similar [collection](https://gitlab.com/dwt1/wallpapers).

## Set the background
- Store the repo under `$HOME/Pictures`
- Create and run a bash script `setbg.sh` as follows
	```
	while true; do
		feh --no-fehbg -z --bg-fill $HOME/Pictures/Wallpapers/*
		sleep 3600
	done 
	```

## Sources and Ownership
The images are mostly obtained from the following sources, and please contact if any picture is yours and I shall take them down.
